# CS229-fall18-Assignments
My personal realization of CS229 fall 2018 from Stanford


PS0 is bare mathmatical calculations, write in paper, don't want to copy into Latex.


All the jupiter notebook in PS are example solutions for the assignment. 
My version is written in psx-ans.tex(psx-ans.pdf) and *.py* files.
